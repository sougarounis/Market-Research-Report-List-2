<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Inertial Measurement Unit Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>MEMS gyroscope-based IMUs</li><li>FOG-based IMUs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors can be classified into two main types: MEMS gyroscope-based IMUs and fiber optic gyroscope (FOG)-based IMUs. MEMS gyroscope-based IMUs are small and cost-effective sensors that measure angular rate using micro-electromechanical systems technology. On the other hand, FOG-based IMUs use optical fibers to measure angular rate, providing higher accuracy and reliability but at a higher cost. Both types of IMUs play a crucial role in providing accurate navigation and stability control systems in automotive applications.</p></p>
