<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Infrared Food Dryer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Continuous Type</li><li>Discontinuous Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Infrared food dryers are classified into two main types: continuous type and discontinuous type. Continuous type infrared food dryers operate continuously without interruption, allowing for large-scale production with consistent drying results. Discontinuous type infrared food dryers, on the other hand, operate in batches, requiring the unit to be stopped and restarted for each batch of food. While continuous type dryers are ideal for high-volume production, discontinuous type dryers are more suitable for smaller-scale operations or when different varieties of food need to be dried separately.</p></p>
