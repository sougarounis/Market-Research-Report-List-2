<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chirped Mirror Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Uncoated</li><li>Coated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Chirped mirrors can be classified into two main market types: uncoated and coated. Uncoated chirped mirrors consist of a bare substrate material without any additional layers. They are typically used in applications where lower reflectivity and dispersion are acceptable. On the other hand, coated chirped mirrors have a thin layer of coating applied to the substrate, enhancing reflectivity and reducing losses. Coated chirped mirrors are commonly used in high-power laser systems where maximum efficiency and performance are required.</p></p>
