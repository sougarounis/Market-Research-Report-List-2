<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Explosion Proof Camera Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Integrated Explosion Proof Camera</li><li>Split Type Explosion Proof Camera</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Integrated explosion proof cameras are those that combine the camera and housing into a single unit, making them easier to install and maintain. They are commonly used in hazardous environments where space is limited. On the other hand, split type explosion proof cameras are separated into two units - the camera and the housing. This allows for greater flexibility in terms of placement and adjustment of the camera angle. Both types of cameras are designed to withstand potential explosions and provide reliable surveillance in high-risk areas.</p></p>
